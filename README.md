# Arduino WebSocket Bridge

This project is part of my ongoing practice to learn and experiment with software-hardware connectivity, focusing on controlling hardware remotely. It serves as a bridge between an Arduino and a web server, enabling real-time communication via WebSockets. The system provides a foundation for remotely controlling devices like LEDs or other components connected to the Arduino.

The main goal of this project is to enhance my understanding of how software and hardware can interact seamlessly and how to control hardware over the internet. This is a step toward mastering the art of IoT (Internet of Things) systems, and it provides hands-on experience with real-time communication, embedded systems, and web development.

## Key Features

- Real-time two-way communication between Arduino and the web via WebSockets.
- Built with Node.js and Arduino to learn cross-platform integration and communication.
